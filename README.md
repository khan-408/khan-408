- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m an AI/ML enthusiast currently pursuing an MBA in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning. With a strong foundation in NLP, GenAI, and deep learning, I specialize in building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.

Iâ€™ve worked on diverse projects involving language models, transformers, recommender systems, and predictive analytics. I enjoy experimenting with the latest advancements in GenAI, LLMs, and agent-based AI, with hands-on experience using tools like TensorFlow, Hugging Face, Cloudera AI Workbench, and AWS.

As an intern, Iâ€™ve collaborated with teams on end-to-end ML pipelines, model deployment, and real-time analytics. Iâ€™m always eager to learn and contribute to impactful AI solutions.
